      <h2>Living Styleguide</h2>
      <p>This website acts as a living reference for the styles that exist on the live website for {{ site.title }}. The two sites share some design elements and components and deviate when necessary.</p>

      <p>The styleguide is broken up into three sections. 'Design Elements' which are the very basic building blocks for the website; 'Components' which combine design elements into working pieces of code that serves a defined purpose; and 'Page Templates'Â which combine the elements and components into page templates that are used to display the content at destination URLs.</p>
